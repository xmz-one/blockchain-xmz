<h1>Introduction</h1>

Relation Network abbreviation (XMZ) is a decentralized multi-chain organization design structure that integrates blockchain high-performance value transmission collaborative network application system. It combines the blockchain design of a variety of different public chains. Its role is to transform the current Each independent block chain is connected, through the Relation Network network to realize the interaction between different block chains, communication and data transmission can be carried out, and the DAO organization protocol network collaborative proposal is designed, which is a highly customizable and modular block chain Infrastructure, which is composed of microkernels and functional modules, Relation Network—XMZ We will provide smart contracts, multi-chain mechanisms and cross-chain organizational structures to break the barriers of blockchain technology, reduce development costs, and promote blockchain technology in the commercial field Applications.<br>
Relation Network is currently the first and only cross-chain DAO protocol that allows users, tokens and DApps (decentralized applications) in different blockchain ecosystems to interact with each other. The Relation Network network is in the block The development organization on the chain provides a framework for resolving disputes and acting as a management agency.
<h1>Program features</h1>
<h2>1.Modular design</h2>
The green design scheme in the blockchain world is the purpose of modular design, which reduces its cost through different functional development attributes, while meeting functional and environmental attributes, and provides product development cycle maintenance and dimensionality reduction processing for market needs.
<h2>2.Parachain</h2>
Relation Network's parachain model introduces high-performance secure network transmission through the Staking consensus mechanism to correct and solve its security, scalability, interoperability and parallel world of governance collaborative networks.
<h2>3.Smart contract</h2>
Relation Network is a system composed of peer-to-peer network nodes, which can create distributed storage and communication services, and implement built-in incentive schemes through the embedded smart contract of the Relation Network network, so that the Relation Network system can self-maintain and operate efficiently in a specific economic governance model.
<h2>4.Relation Network consensus mechanism</h2>
We will adopt a hybrid consensus mechanism of POS, DPOS, and CBFT to govern the economic model organization structure in the Relation Network system. Through the dual mechanism of proof of work and proof of rights and interests, we will solve the election plan of cryptocurrency in the issuance process and the network in the election system. Stability and algorithm accuracy are superior to production governance issues.
<h2>5. DAO Collaborative Network</h2>
In the decentralized system, Relation Network designed the DAO governance protocol, so that in the process of organizational governance of the system ecology, consensus building and organizational contribution provision, openness, co-governance, sharing, co-construction, and co-creation are organized into different blocks. The chain project carries out high empowerment, high concurrency, and high governance to present the governance of its core collaboration network.
<h1>getting Started</h1>
<h2>1.operating system</h2>
Relation Network—XMZ is based on Java's latest spring-boot architecture, you can choose your favorite operating system.
<h2>2.rely</h2>

Maven：Maven 3.3+<br>
IDE：Whatever you like
<h2>3.Technology Architecture</h2>
1.spring-boot 2.5.0<br>
2.RocksDB 6.8.1<br>
3.httpclient 4.5.3<br>
4.kryo 4.0.1<br>

<h1>Technical explanation</h1>
1.SpringBoot is designed based on Spring 4.0, which not only inherits the original excellent features of the Spring framework, but also further simplifies the entire construction and development process of Spring applications by simplifying the configuration. In addition, SpringBoot integrates a large number of frameworks so that the version conflicts of dependent packages and the instability of references have been well resolved.<br>
2.RocksDB is an embedded key-value storage system from Facebook that supports persistence. It can also be used as a storage database in C/S mode, but the main purpose is still embedded. RocksDB is built on LevelDB。<br>
3.HttpClient is a sub-project of Apache Jakarta Common, which can be used to provide an efficient, up-to-date and feature-rich client programming toolkit that supports the HTTP protocol  <br>
4.Kryo is a high-performance serialization/deserialization tool. Due to its variable-length storage characteristics and the use of a bytecode generation mechanism, it has a higher operating speed and a smaller size.  <br>
5.Guava is a Java library based on open source. Google Guava originated from "Google Collections Library" in 2007. This library is to facilitate coding and reduce coding errors. This library is used to provide practical methods for collections, caching, support for original statements, concurrency, common annotations, string processing, I/O and verification.  <br>
6.bcprov-jdk15on is a necessary encryption toolkit for SM2 encryption.
